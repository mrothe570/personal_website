        <h2>Thanks for stopping by...</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Michael Rothe. I'm an aspiring web developer living in Springfield, Missouri.
        </p>
        <p>When it comes
            to
            design, the Queen City of the Ozarks is probably most famous for the "Jazz" logo you saw on all of the paper
            cups at house parties during the 90s. It looks like this:
        </p>
        <div id="img">
            <img src="images/solo_jazz_transparent.png" alt="Jazz logo design">
        </div>
        <p>
            I hope to change that! I think, when it comes to smart, informed design, you need a strong philosophy
            guiding your hand. And that's how I approach designing web pages and digital media.
            Here, you'll find different projects that I've worked on, relevant and sometimes whacky thoughts I've
            excised from my head, and helpful links that reflect what I value both personally and professionally. Feel
            free to stick around or send me a question if you'd like! And be sure to check out the quick FAQ section at
            the bottom of this page.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>So what exactly <i>is</i> your design philosophy?</h3>
        <p>
            I believe in a supplementary, accessible web. A supplementary web experience, to me,
            does as
            much as it can to guide the user along their journey, whatever that may be, without worrying as much about
            engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Individual autonomy is important. In the age of interstital pop-ups, endless notifications, dark patterns,
            and
            on and on, it's important for people to feel like the things they encounter while using the web are working
            with
            them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reflecting your personal philosophy in the work that you do can be tricky, but for me it boils down to a few
            things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>&bull; designing apps and pages with contrast and readability as the main consideration</li>
            <li>&bull; prioritizing fast-loading, low-data-impact formatting</li>
            <li>&bull; applying consistent and thoughtful color psychology concepts</li>
            <li>&bull; keeping frictionless experiences frictionless, but adding friction where it's necessary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The first three points are somewhat universal for designers, but the last is something of my own rumination.
            But it goes back to the idea that user autonomy is key and should be one of the foundational considerations
            of
            any well-designed web experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            A social media site like Twitter, for instance, features its feed. Which, as we all know, is a curated
            scroll
            consisting of everyone you follow and all of their engagements on Twitter. If just a little bit of friction
            were
            added to this experience, like requiring users to enter the Twitter handle of the account whose content they
            wish to view, users could spend a lot less time browsing Twitter and Facebook and a lot more of doing what
            they
            got onto their device for.
        </p>
        <h3>What is your background?</h3>
        <p>
            Before self-teaching with freeCodeCamp and Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 2021, I was a student at
            Missouri
            State University studying professional and technical writing. I did not finish my degree while at MSU, but
            have
            continued to focus on applying the concepts I learned for page design and technical writing to my work doing
            web
            design.</p>
        <p>
            I've worked for different local businesses here in Springfield doing social media work in different
            capacities,
            and even ran a few campaigns for Missouri State University's Career Center. These mostly involved different
            Career Center events on campus, targeted at students within the different schools at MSU. I became more
            focused
            on web design after some work done with Lionbridge Technologies in the capacity of Rater, which led to some
            research into common SEO techniques and practices like page optimization and keyword search term ranking,
            which
            finally led into crafting modern websites and my own design phliosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I've made a point to brush up on the more foundational aspects of design.
            Concepts like color theory, typography composition, the golden ratio, and grid theory are the most basic
            concepts when it comes to design. A strong foundational knowledge in these areas will serve anyone who wants
            to create great user experiences with informed design decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning these concepts also taught me some of the more basic concepts from the most popular graphic design
            programs:
        <ul>
            <li>&bull; Adobe Photoshop</li>
            <li>&bull; Adobe Illustrator</li>
            <li>&bull; Adobe InDesign</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What are your goals for your career?</h3>
        <p>
            I want to have a solid foundation in every aspect of web app design and deployment. I want to become
            familiar
            with the following languages and tools to understand how they work in tandem:
        <ul>
            <li>&bull; HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li>&bull; computer science concepts, algorithms, data structures, and databases</li>
            <li>&bull; Python and basic data science libraries</li>
            <li>&bull; command line tools</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to be at a place in my career where I can call myself a full stack web developer and be in a position
            to
            provide leadership and mentorship to people who are wanting to forge their own career path like me.
